# Real Time Writing Analysis - ProText ANR

*"The Pro-TEXT project aims to elucidate the dynamics of the textualization process by modeling the relations between the temporal indices of cognitive processes (such as pauses) and the nature of bursts of writing in French and in English-French translations. We argue that the way linguistic sequences linearly articulate during the process of textualization accounts for: i) the multilevel constraints underlying language performance and ii) specific relationships outside the scope of clause syntax."*

## 1 - Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This repository concerns a specific branch of the project aiming to find connections between pausal segmentation and specific linguistic features, notably chunks. 
To get to that point, a few steps were required :
- Extracting our data to make "usable"
- Reconstructing texts while keeping a history of the user's writing behaviours
- Chunking those texts and maintaning
